# Verification Using SystemVerilog

This repository contains **SystemVerilog-based verification examples and testbenches** for digital designs. It focuses on demonstrating practical verification methodologies including constrained random testing, assertions, functional coverage, and simple UVM-lite approaches.

## Contents

- **Combinational & Sequential Modules**  
  Example designs like multiplexers, adders, flip-flops, and counters.

- **Testbenches**  
  Self-contained verification environments using SystemVerilog constructs such as `initial`, `always`, `forever`, `assertions`, and `randomization`.

- **UVM-Lite Examples**  
  Lightweight UVM-style testbench structures for practicing modular and reusable verification.

- **Simulations**  
  Scripts and instructions for simulating the designs using popular simulators (e.g., ModelSim, QuestaSim).

## Features

- Demonstrates **8x1, 4x1 MUX verification** using SystemVerilog.
- Shows **constrained random test generation**.
- Illustrates **assertions and coverage** for functional verification.
- Includes **step-by-step simulation instructions**.
